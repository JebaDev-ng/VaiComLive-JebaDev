# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for addressing security vulnerabilities identified by npm audit in the Vai Com Live project. The primary vulnerability is a moderate-severity issue in esbuild (CVE GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) that enables unauthorized requests to the development server. The fix requires upgrading Vite from version 5.4.19 to 7.1.11, which is a major version upgrade requiring careful testing and validation.

## Glossary

- **Application**: The Vai Com Live React-based web application
- **Vite**: The build tool and development server used by the Application
- **esbuild**: A JavaScript bundler used internally by Vite
- **Development Server**: The local server instance running during development via `npm run dev`
- **Production Build**: The compiled output generated by `npm run build`
- **Dependency Tree**: The hierarchical structure of npm packages and their dependencies
- **Breaking Changes**: API or behavior modifications that may cause existing code to fail

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate known security vulnerabilities in the project dependencies, so that the development environment is protected from potential exploits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs `npm audit`, THE Application SHALL report zero moderate or higher severity vulnerabilities
2. THE Application SHALL use esbuild version greater than 0.24.2
3. THE Application SHALL use Vite version 7.1.11 or higher
4. WHEN vulnerabilities are resolved, THE Application SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the Vite upgrade does not break existing functionality, so that the application continues to work correctly after the security fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs `npm run dev`, THE Development Server SHALL start successfully on port 8080
2. WHEN the developer runs `npm run build`, THE Application SHALL compile without errors
3. WHEN the developer runs `npm run preview`, THE Production Build SHALL serve correctly
4. THE Application SHALL render all pages without console errors
5. THE Application SHALL maintain all routing functionality via React Router DOM

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and resolve any breaking changes from the Vite major version upgrade, so that the build configuration remains compatible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL review Vite 7.x migration guide for breaking changes
2. WHEN breaking changes are identified, THE Application SHALL update configuration files accordingly
3. THE Application SHALL update vite.config.ts if required by Vite 7.x
4. THE Application SHALL verify all Vite plugins remain compatible with version 7.x
5. THE Application SHALL maintain TypeScript compilation settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all development and build scripts continue to function, so that the development workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs `npm run lint`, THE Application SHALL execute ESLint without errors
2. WHEN the developer runs `npm run build:dev`, THE Application SHALL create a development build successfully
3. THE Application SHALL maintain all custom npm scripts functionality
4. THE Application SHALL preserve hot module replacement (HMR) behavior during development

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure third-party dependencies remain compatible after the Vite upgrade, so that no runtime errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL verify @vitejs/plugin-react-swc compatibility with Vite 7.x
2. THE Application SHALL verify vite-plugin-svgr compatibility with Vite 7.x
3. WHEN incompatible plugins are found, THE Application SHALL upgrade them to compatible versions
4. THE Application SHALL test all major features including i18n, routing, and animations
5. THE Application SHALL verify Tailwind CSS compilation works correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to document the changes made during the security fix, so that the team understands what was updated and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL create a changelog entry documenting the Vite upgrade
2. THE Application SHALL document any configuration changes made
3. THE Application SHALL document any breaking changes encountered and their resolutions
4. THE Application SHALL include verification steps performed
